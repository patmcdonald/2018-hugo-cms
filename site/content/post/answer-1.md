# Hey Chris

### Here's my selection from your [support-tasks gist](https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6)

To be straight up - there's nothing legal that I wouldn't do to get the job done, and learn at the same time!

### My 5 favourite activities from this list are:

1. Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model
2. Respond to 50+ support requests via email or chat most days
3. Spot trends across many cases to improve Netlify's product and service.
4. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before.
5. Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging.

### My 5 least favourite activities from this list are

1. Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems.
2. Respond to Netlify customers on Twitter.
